# VueData - Consulting Website ðŸ’»
---

At VueData, I interned as a Website Development Intern at VueData, I was involved in utilizing the Django Framework along with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python to develop a sophisticated consulting website tailored for internal HR use. In addition to coding and front-end design, I took charge of designing and implementing a robust database using MySQL to support seamless backend development. This comprehensive approach not only expanded my proficiency in web development technologies but also provided invaluable hands-on experience in crafting functional and user-friendly solutions to meet organizational needs.
