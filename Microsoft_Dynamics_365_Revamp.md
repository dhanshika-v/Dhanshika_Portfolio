# Dynamics 365 Revamp 

During my role as a Discovery Intern at Microsoft, I engaged in an enriching learning journey focused on advancing my technical prowess in Python and mastering the collaborative tools within Azure DevOps. Working closely with the Customer Experience & Success team, I tackled challenges aimed at enhancing support infrastructure. Throughout the internship, I played a pivotal role in developing a solution to improve the efficiency of communication among Support Engineers using Dynamics 365. By integrating new features, our solution streamlined communication processes, fostering a more productive workflow. This experience deepened my technical skills while also honing my ability to solve customer-centric challenges within a dynamic team environment.

## Project Overview: 

How can engineers maintain a first quality resolution with customers effectively managing customer expectations while navigating different tools to resolve the customer's issue quickly?

DfM is a case management solution that assists Support Engineers and Advocates the ability to assist Microsoft's commercial and consumer customer.

### üë• **Users**  
Microsoft support engineers using **MD365**

### ‚ùì **Problem**  
Communication between support engineers and customers is inefficient.

---

### üí° **Solution**  
Embed a **Teams chat box** within the MD365 workspace to allow faster communication and ensure problems are solved efficiently.


## Key Considerations: 
- Re-vamp of User Interface for Dynamics for Microsoft Tool
- Integrated Chatbot

## User Story: 
*"As a business customer I want to know who has access to my case information so, I can maintain privacy and confidentially of my personal information."*

## Key Takeways:
- One-stop shop for all things communication
- Signficantly reduce SLA first resolution time with customer and collaboration time between interal engineers
- A customized dashboard for engineers to work on cases and collaboration

## Early Development:
(No pictures for company confidently)
- Dynamics 365 had a fixed layout
- was not customizable for personal preferences 
- only presented intromation pertaining to the problem, no details like contact info or additional commentary to solve the presented problem
- Support engineers had to manually contact the customers
- There was a lack of ease in acess

## Post Development 
### üí¨ **TEAMS Chat Features**

- **All TEAMS chat features are implemented** with **additional enhancements** üõ†Ô∏è
