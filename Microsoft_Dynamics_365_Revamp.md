During my role as a Discovery Intern at Microsoft, I engaged in an enriching learning journey focused on advancing my technical prowess in Python and mastering the collaborative tools within Azure DevOps.

Throughout the internship, I played a pivotal role in developing a solution to improve the efficiency of communication among Support Engineers using Dynamics 365. By integrating new features, our solution streamlined communication processes, fostering a more productive workflow. This experience deepened my technical skills while also honing my ability to solve customer-centric challenges within a dynamic team environment.
