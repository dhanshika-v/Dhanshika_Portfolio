MyPlan Revamped
INFO 200 Project Final Prototype

### Problem Statement

Our focus target audience are current UW students and the main general platform that we address here is UW‚Äôs online academic planning tool, MyPlan and MyUW. We are going to investigate potential limitations of the website‚Äôs user interface and make a better revised plan to increase the productivity and efficiency of the application. We are thinking of tackling certain sections such as the registration for classes better. Many students struggle with planning their academics. We will make changes that make the process smoother, efficient and practical. Without creating a proper solution it will make it harder for students to find the right classes and finish their degrees on time.

## Solutions Considered
## Solution 1 - MyPlan Instructions Website

<img width="468" alt="Picture1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abe273d9-f567-4000-9d4e-332ccb6b102c">


One solution to improve MyPlan is to incorporate a website or a page on MyPlan itself that includes instructions and tutorials for the many features on MyPlan. This way, whenever a user is confused or needs assistance, they can easily find and go to this page to receive clarifications instead of searching for answers outside of MyPlan. The advantages of having this solution is that it can not only instruct students when they first start using MyPlan, and users can access it at any time when they have questions. However, a disadvantage of this solution is that the instructions website will not adjust MyPlan to be more usable, but only give clearer direction no matter how confusing the platform may be.


## Solution 2 - MyPlan Interactive Orientation

<img width="468" alt="hhhh" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/771ca4cc-e0e1-44ad-bcd7-535de21d3484">


Having an orientation, either in person or virtually on a meeting platform, is one way to provide direction for students using MyPlan and therefore make it easier for them to use. A strength of this solution is that users can interact with an orientation leader, who would be knowledgeable in MyPlan‚Äôs features, allowing them to ask questions they might not find answers to themselves. After attending an orientation, users can take the information they learned and apply it to their future use. On the other hand, a limitation is that this is a one-time event held at the beginning of the school year or quarter. This makes it difficult for students who transfer to the University of Washington in the middle of a term, anyone who misses the orientation, or anyone who wants continuous access to an interactive introduction to the platform.


## Solution 3 - MyPlan with Google Calendar

<img width="468" alt="h" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67f80003-79fe-47a5-ba1c-33d0f2b666bf">


Adding a feature that allows users to combine their personal Google Calendar with MyPlan‚Äôs schedule builder is a solution that gives users much more ease in planning their classes around other events, such as work, clubs, and more. This allows students to easily see the overlaps between the classes they can have in mind and their personal schedule, letting them plan for a realistic and successful schedule for each quarter. A downside of this solution is that it complicates MyPlan, which can distract users from the complex schedule builder as it is now, instead of providing help. This is especially true for users who do not also use Google Calendar, as this solution does not apply to them at all.


## Solution 4 - Updating MyPlan Itself

<img width="468" alt="ghg" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5abb5b53-4c67-4cd1-a6d9-0db9f63b3cec">


Adjusting MyPlan‚Äôs current features is another solution, as it allows for narrowing down on various, specific problem spots to edit while keeping the useful qualities the same. Updating MyPlan will benefit users because it can add clarification to the features that already exist and create convenient shortcuts that give access to features that otherwise would have to be thoroughly searched for or are not available at all. Adding personalization features can help users stay organized through their own habits, rather than forcing them to create new ones. However, a disadvantage to changing parts of MyPlan as a whole is that current users may already be used to using MyPlan as it is and would therefore have to relearn how to use the platform with its new features.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Selected Solution ‚≠êÔ∏è
After listing all potential solutions, we decided that the best course of action is to focus our efforts solely on updating the design of MyPlan to improve its usability and accessibility. This decision was made based on the fact that MyPlan is the central platform that connects current students with the University of Washington. Academic planning and tracking, as well as class scheduling, are all done through this platform. Hence-why, students are comfortable and familiar with this platform and by eliminating the unnecessaries and improving it will enhance their experience further.

Compared to other potential solutions, stakeholders, especially students, are most comfortable and familiar with MyPlan as it is an existing platform. By leveraging it, we can ensure an immediate impact. Removing unnecessary features and improving the design can ultimately minimize user resistance.
It stands out as the best solution as MyPlan is the aforementioned main platform and by refining a platform that is already an integral part of a student's academics, we aim to deliver the best experience for students where they can feel comfortable navigating through their university lives.


## Description of Our Solution
### Product Features

**Primary Features**

**Feature 1:** Personalized Calendar that allows users to tailor the provided calendar according to their liking (hyperlink). Just like the academic calendar already provided in the original MyPlan, there is a list that contains the academic events and holidays. Another feature added which would be useful is the ‚ÄòReminder‚Äô section which allows users to be reminded of the upcoming events, as well the ‚ÄòAdd to list‚Äô button which would allow users to add their own to-do list.

**Feature 2:** Asterisk symbol indicating a footnote (additional information) about a specific feature. In this case, the asterisk symbol is placed next to selected features in MyPlan‚Äôs homepage signifying that people frequently visit or use this specific feature. An example is shown in our design prototype as the asterisk beside build a schedule shows how it is frequently visited. By using this, we have made some sort of classification for MyPlan‚Äôs features that grabs their attention towards specific features that are mostly used.


**Secondary Features**
**Feature Name:** Personalized to-do list feature. We proposed a feature where users can have a todo-list that is connected to MyPlan and its features, but in a more personalized way. For example, users can add a to-do list to indicate when they should register for a course. This way, users can have a more to-do list which is more integrated and connected to MyPlan and its features. 

**Feature Name:** A specific button for contacting students‚Äô academic advisor. We have implemented this since we thought that users, students specifically, have a convenient way to contact their advisor. This omits the need to navigate to MyUW to contact their advisor.

**Feature Name:** A question mark icon beside features (in the form of hyperlinks) that pops up a box that contains more information about the specific feature. This question mark icon feature is specifically implemented beside hyperlinks features which makes use of a lot of terminologies, such as schedule builder, or audit degree (DARS). This allows users to get a glimpse of where the hyperlink will take them, along with what the feature actually does.



**Low-Fidelity Wireframing Stage**

After finalizing the low-fidelity wireframes*, we asked the users for their thoughts on the redesign. Here are some of their quotes:

- *‚ÄúI think the calendar is actually necessary, just because we‚Äôve been using external calendars platform, why not have it directly linked to our MyPlan!‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been trying to figure out how who is my academic advisor for the longest time, because I know we have one as they talked about it in the orientation, but I just forgot and only know how to look for them in my third quarter, it would definitely be useful for incoming freshman‚Äù*

And this is the feedback we took into account and revised it to our (final) high-fidelity wireframes:

*- ‚ÄúThe features of MyPlan still confuse me, and I think you should find a way to allow users to know what each features do‚Äù*

We have created a small question mark icon that allows users to hover over it in order to see detailed information about the corresponding feature. As users become more familiar with the layout and presentation of features and buttons in the current, original MyPlan, we believe it would be helpful to simply add question mark icons to some of the important features, rather than redesigning the entire layout.

## **Design Language / Style Guide**

### Font 
MyPlan is an University of Washington application, and we are revamping it to be easier for the user to interact with. Since we are using a pre-existing application we need to maintain design choices implemented in the application, and rather enhance the productivity of the product. Therefore, we maintained the font ‚ÄúLato‚Äù throughout the new MyPlan design. 

<img width="141" alt="dd" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/236abccc-d2d4-44d6-88e2-1ef8e7208603">


### Colors
Since we are creating a revamped version of MyPlan instead of building a proposed website or application from scratch, most the color palette and themes used for our final design is mostly based on UW‚Äôs color theme - which is purple (#49317B in hex code). Yet, for most of the specific features - such as when users hover above our drop down menu design, or when they hover over a button - which we implemented ourselves, we went for a lighter shade of that color by increasing the white intensity. Furthermore, for our proposed personalization page, we searched for matching color palettes and combinations with the initial purple theme, and found that a light shade of brown matches the purple color, combining vibrant and soft colors. By doing so, the theme of our website will not only be less stagnant and monotone with purple colors, but also looks pleasing and comfortable to the eye.

### Onboarding 
**Intuitive and descriptive homepage layout:**

<img width="410" alt="hjk" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e521792a-4486-4a00-a125-7f33da64b88e">


- Drop down menus that highlight user current selection to allow users to conveniently access features that are related to their academic advisor (eg. contact them)
- Question mark icons in home page that when users hover over each one, shows a description of what the feature does; or where the user will be directed to when clicking the hyperlink
- Add and remove from list icons that change colors every time users interact with them, allowing ease of altering personalized reminders.

## Interactive Prototype

We used Figma to make our interactive prototype for MyPlan Revamped, which can be accessed through the following link:
https://www.figma.com/proto/9XkqHZL7sensi0YXg40xIn/Group6-MyPlan-Revamped?type=design&node-id=1-6&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A6

This link is the process (behind the scenes):

**Important notes** (for presentation purposes):
- There were several notes in the Figma file itself that occasionally appear beside each frame to indicate the way users are expected to run / present our interactive project. 
ie)
  - When presenting in visual schedule frame
      - Click add personalized events first, then
      - Add selected classes 
- Also, buttons on the ‚Äòpersonalization‚Äô page on the left side of the frame are all supposed to link to external websites (such as clicking registration dates will link to this site: https://registrar.washington.edu/registration/periods/ and vice versa). We excluded it for simplicity purposes and so that users remain in Figma, instead of being redirected to an external site. However, one exception of this is the visual schedule button which links to another series of frames.

Here is our final proposed homepage layout. We did not change much in terms of layout, however, we added several functions that would make the website easier to navigate and look at, and also more convenient for user experience. We added several features to the already existing layout of MyPlan that we believe, and also based on our research, would be beneficial for students. The features we implemented include an asterisk signifier, a question mark icon/symbol beside specific hyperlinks, and a contact academic advisor instant button. 

### Academic Calendar Page

<img width="468" alt="hiihii" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31c57d31-af51-49e2-afbb-d17ff86894a4">

Here is the page that is directed to when the user clicks on the hyperlink ‚ÄúPersonalized Calendar‚Äù. This is essentially a way for users to integrate more personality in their MyPlan as we have noticed that according to our research on UX, users tend to use third party applications such as google drive or google calendar to mark specific events and remind them of to-do activities. Here, we implemented a way for users to integrate more of the features of third party applications such as to-do lists and integrate them with MyPlan. For example, users can note a to-do in here indicating which classes they have to search for. Hence, the to-do list here is more connected to MyPlan and its features (such as registering for a specific class) instead of a normal, generalized to-do list. 

The ‚Äòfilter by‚Äô list shows a list of the upcoming events that is indicated in this website: (https://www.washington.edu/students/reg/begendcal.html) but filtered into categories for ease of access and convenience. 

### Academic Calendar Page - Weekly

<img width="468" alt="fghjkjhgf" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c5569c0-3922-4cef-914d-7586cfb27e54">

Weekly planners are useful tools for students because they promote accountability, flexibility, organization, time management, visualization, and goal-setting. You may increase your productivity, lower your stress level, and keep on top of your academic obligations by using a planner to schedule your classes. Having your personal commitments displayed on the weekly planner will make it easier for choosing a specific class. Using the button on the top right called: ‚ÄúAdd Personal Event‚Äù you can populate the weekly calendar to have events that you may have other than classes to attend. For many students, since they are unaware and sometimes forget their pre existing commitments, this tool will be helpful for students to decide what classes and specific course load they need to be successful.

<img width="468" alt="ujmn" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/404dbcab-6580-45e7-9549-be08b43c875a">

This is the same weekly calendar after populating the classes that are selected. To do this just through one click which is located on the top right corner called: ‚ÄúAdd Selected Class‚Äù. This way the user can see their classes with their other commitments and decide the best schedule and also do not double book. Since this is a weekly layout they will get a better understanding how their weeks will be and plan other activities best.
