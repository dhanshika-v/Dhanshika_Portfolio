Themes: Sustainability, supporting local businesses, shopping organically 

Problem Statement: Many people want to shop locally and sustainably, but struggle to find nearby farmers markets and vendors. This lack of awareness also means that vendors and markets miss out on potential business. 

Solution Overview:  Seattle Fresh is a one-stop platform for Seattle locals looking to support local markets and shop sustainably. We provide detailed information about nearby farmers markets and vendors selling fresh groceries and handmade goods, filling the gap left by current platforms. By using Seattle Fresh, users will be able to browse markets, products, save favorites, read/write vendor reviews, and learn about markets/vendors for a personalized shopping experience. Our design prioritizes accessibility through the use of high contrast colors and bold fonts, catering to low vision users. With a focus on engaging Seattle locals, our impact will be measured by account creation and user interaction metrics.
